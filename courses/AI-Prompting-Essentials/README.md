# AI Prompting Essentials

Looking for a reliable way to write prompts? We’ll show you a 5-step framework that works with different tools and models. If your prompt doesn’t work the first time, don’t worry – that’s normal! You’ll learn how to review and improve it until you get the results you want.

- [ ] Learn what “prompting” means when using AI tools to create text, images, or other cool things.
- [ ] Use a simple guide (task, context, examples, feedback, improve) to make your AI prompts work better.
- [ ] See why checking AI’s responses and tweaking your prompts is the secret to getting awesome results.
- [ ] Discover how to combine text, images, and other formats to create multimodal prompts.
- [ ] Understand why it’s important for people, not just AI, to stay in control when working with AI tools.
- [ ] Learn about the ethical risks of using AI (like bias) and how to use AI in a fair and responsible way.
- [ ] Know what AI can and can’t do, spot when it’s struggling, and figure out how to handle those situations.

# Module 1 - Prompt Like a PRO

Welcome to **Module 1: Prompt Like a PRO**. In this lesson, you'll learn how to craft effective prompts using the TCREI framework: Task, Context, Reference, Evaluate, Iterate. This structured approach will help you communicate clearly with AI tools to achieve the best results.

## TCREI Framework Overview

1. **Task**: Define what you want the AI to accomplish.
2. **Context**: Provide background information to inform the AI's response.
3. **Reference**: Include examples or resources that guide the AI.
4. **Evaluate**: Assess the AI's output for quality and relevance.
5. **Iterate**: Refine your prompt based on the evaluation to improve results.

You can remember TCREI framework as "Thoughtfully Create Excellent Inputs" like below:

1. **Thoughtfully**: Describe your task, specifying a persona and format preference.
2 **Create**: Include any context the gen AI tool might need to give you what you want.
3 **Really**: Add references the gen AI tool can use to inform its output.
4 **Excellent**: Next, evaluate the output to identify opportunities for improvement. 
5 **Inputs**: Then, iterate on your initial prompt to attain those improvements.

## 1. Task

**Definition:** Clearly state the objective or the specific task you want the AI to perform.

### Examples

**Example 1: Basic Task Definition**
- *Prompt:* "Write a story."

**Example 2: Defined Task with Specifics**
- *Prompt:* "Write a 500-word short story set in a dystopian future where technology controls human emotions."

**Example 3: Task with Desired Outcome**
- *Prompt:* "Develop a marketing email that promotes our new eco-friendly water bottle, highlighting its sustainability features and encouraging customers to purchase."

---

## 2. Context

**Definition:** Provide relevant background information that helps the AI understand the scenario and nuances of the task.

### Examples

**Example 1: Insufficient Context**
- *Prompt:* "Explain machine learning."

**Example 2: Improved Context**
- *Prompt:* "Explain machine learning in simple terms for a high school biology class, focusing on how it can be used to predict genetic variations."

**Example 3: Detailed Context**
- *Prompt:* "Explain machine learning to a group of graduate students in computer science, covering supervised and unsupervised learning, and include real-world applications in healthcare and finance."

---

## 3. Reference

**Definition:** Include examples, templates, or resources that can guide the AI in generating the desired response.

### Examples

**Example 1: Without Reference**
- *Prompt:* "Create a project plan."

**Example 2: With Example Reference**
- *Prompt:* "Create a project plan similar to the following example: [Insert example here]. Ensure it includes timelines, milestones, and responsible parties."

**Example 3: Multiple References**
- *Prompt:* "Create a project plan for launching a mobile app, referencing the Agile methodology and including Gantt charts as shown in the provided templates."

---

## 4. Evaluate

**Definition:** Assess the AI's output to determine if it meets your requirements and identify areas for improvement.

### Examples

**Example 1: Basic Evaluation**
- *Prompt:* "Evaluate the effectiveness of this marketing strategy."

**Example 2: Structured Evaluation**
- *Prompt:* "Evaluate the effectiveness of this marketing strategy by analyzing its reach, engagement, conversion rates, and ROI. Provide suggestions for improvement."

**Example 3: Detailed Evaluation Criteria**
- *Prompt:* "Evaluate the effectiveness of this marketing strategy using the following criteria: target audience alignment, message clarity, channel selection, budget allocation, and performance metrics. Highlight strengths and weaknesses in each area."

---

## 5. Iterate

**Definition:** Refine and adjust your prompt based on the evaluation to enhance the quality and relevance of the AI's responses.

### Examples

**Example 1: Simple Iteration**
- *Initial Prompt:* "Generate social media posts."
- *Revised Prompt:* "Generate three engaging social media posts for Instagram promoting our summer sale, each with a catchy headline and relevant hashtags."

**Example 2: Feedback-Based Iteration**
- *Initial Prompt:* "Explain climate change."
- *Feedback:* The explanation was too technical.
- *Revised Prompt:* "Explain climate change in layman's terms for a general audience, avoiding complex scientific jargon and using relatable examples."

**Example 3: Iteration with Added Constraints**
- *Initial Prompt:* "Design a logo."
- *Feedback:* The logo needs to reflect sustainability.
- *Revised Prompt:* "Design a logo for our eco-friendly brand that incorporates green colors and leaf motifs to emphasize sustainability and nature."
