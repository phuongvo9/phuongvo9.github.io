# Getting Started with DevOps: The Basics

Welcome to the **Getting Started with DevOps: The Basicss**. This blog will help you understand the cultural and technological transformation required to make your DevOps initiative successful and allow it to flourish.

## Why DevOps?

According to a recent DevOps Institute report, demand for DevOps skills is expected to grow 122% over the next five years, making it one of the fastest-growing skills in the workforce. However, having skills alone won’t ensure success. Gartner predicts that through 2022, 75% of DevOps initiatives will fail to meet expectations due to issues around organizational learning and change.

### The Importance of Culture

The number one reason for failing to meet expectations is not around skills or tools, but due to issues around organizational learning and cultural change. Cultural change can have a significant positive effect on DevOps's success. According to George Spafford, Senior Director Analyst at Gartner, “People-related factors tend to be the greatest challenges—not technology.”

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is not a tool or a job title. DevOps is the practice of development and operations engineers working together through the entire software development lifecycle, following Lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver software in a rapid and continuous manner

### Key Principles of DevOps

1. **Collaboration**: Development and operations teams work together, sharing responsibilities and combining their workflows.
2. **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks to improve efficiency and reduce errors.
3. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**: Ensuring that every change is integrated and delivered quickly and safely.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Keeping track of performance and issues in real-time to ensure reliability and quick resolution of problems.

## Changing the Culture

To change your culture, you need to learn new ways of thinking, working, organizing, and measuring. Here are some strategies:

### Thinking Differently

- **Social Coding**: Encouraging collaboration through platforms like GitHub to improve software reuse and sharing.
- **Lean Manufacturing Principles**: Working in small batches to reduce waste and creating minimum viable products to gain valuable insights.

### Working Differently

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before code to ensure high quality.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Ensuring that software behaves as expected through examples and scenarios.

### Organizing Differently

How you organize your teams directly impacts the architecture and design of the products you produce. Teams should be cross-functional, including members from development, operations, and other relevant areas.

### Measuring Differently

Changing your measurement system to encourage the correct behavior is critical for success. Avoid vanity metrics and focus on actionable metrics that provide valuable insights about your product and customers.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Netflix

Netflix is a prime example of a company that has successfully implemented DevOps. They use automated testing and deployment pipelines to ensure that new features are delivered quickly and reliably. Their culture of experimentation and learning from failures has allowed them to innovate rapidly.

### Example 2: Amazon

Amazon’s use of DevOps practices has enabled them to deploy code every 11.7 seconds on average. Their focus on automation and continuous delivery has helped them maintain high availability and performance

## Conclusion

Implementing a DevOps initiative isn’t easy, but it can be very rewarding. To embrace the DevOps culture, you must be willing to make changes, experiment, and understand that failures are learning opportunities. Foster the core values of teamwork, accountability, and trust.

Join me in exploring how you can transform the culture and technology of your organization so that your DevOps journey will be a successful one. Remember, we don’t “do” DevOps… we “become” DevOps!
