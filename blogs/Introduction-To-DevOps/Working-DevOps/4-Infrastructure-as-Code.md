# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a revolutionary approach to managing IT infrastructure. It involves defining  infrastructure setup—such as servers, networks, and software—in a textual format that is executable as code

## Key Benefits of IaC
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent recreation of environments
- **Version Control**: Collaborative change tracking and rollback
- **Error Reduction**: Automation minimizes human errors

---

## IaC Tools
- **Configuration Management Systems**: Ansible, Puppet, Chef
- **Provisioning Tools**: Terraform, CloudFormation
- **Containerization Technologies**: Docker, Kubernetes

---

## The Need for Automation
Manual configuration is labor-intensive and error-prone. With IaC:
- Use templates and scripts for consistent provisioning
- Automate repetitive tasks for scalability and reliability

---

## IaC in Action
Steps to deploy a web application:
1. Define required servers and configurations.
2. Automate installation of software dependencies.
3. Ensure environment parity between development and production.
